## How to use

All components are imported from '@app-components'

`import { Button, InputText, TextArea } from '@app-components;`

and you can use them as normal react components.

```
const Example = () => {
    return(){
        <form>
            <InputText onChange={onChange} value={value} label="Email" name="email" />
            <TextArea onChange={onChange} value={value} label="Message" name="message" />
            <Button type="submit" primary size="large">Save</Button>
        </form>
    }
}
```
